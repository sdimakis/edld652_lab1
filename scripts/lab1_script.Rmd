# He said in class that you can just use theme_minimal() if you can't figure out the background
```


# Plot 2 rough draft

```{r, message = FALSE}
#adding a month variable that is created_at rounded to the nearest month
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::round_date(created_at, unit = "month"))  

#creating figure
fig_2 <- data %>% 
  filter(month < lubridate::as_datetime("2019-01-01 00:00:00")) %>% #filtering months before 2019
  group_by(month) %>% #group by month
  summarize(n = n()) %>% #count observations per month
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) +
    geom_line() + #add black line
    geom_smooth() #add blue line with se 


```


# Finalized Plot 2

Meg
```{r}
# He hinted that you can use geom_ribbon() to shade underneath the curve but it might be easier to just use geom_area()
#updated figure with visual edits
